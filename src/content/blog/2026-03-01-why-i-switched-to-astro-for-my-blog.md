title: Why I Switched to Astro for My Blog
---

I've been using Jekyll for years, but recently made the switch to Astro. Here's why.

## Speed

Astro's partial hydration model means your site ships zero JavaScript by default. Pages load instantly.

## Developer Experience

The component model is familiar if you know React or Vue, but outputs pure HTML.

## Conclusion

If you're building a content-heavy site, Astro is worth a serious look.
